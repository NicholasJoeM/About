          After deciding to pursue a career in software development, I knew immediately that nothing short of an immersive and structured learning experience to equip me with the minimum required technical skills was going to get me there. Through months of consistent research, I’d finally settled on enrolling into a software engineering bootcamp, and must say, it turned out to be one of the best, albeit few life decisions I've ever made.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bootcamp experience was unlike any I'd undergone. Over several months, I was exposed to a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and development tools. The curriculum took a project-based approach, allowing me to learn by building real-world applications. This hands-on experience was invaluable, and we became increasingly more confident as we collaborated to tackle complex coding challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the bootcamp, many positive conditions were met that jointly cultivated a truly rewarding experience. The sense of community as an aspect of the bootcamp was incredible. Everyone, from instructors to fellow students, was eager to foster a successful cohort. This promoted a supportive learning environment where I felt comfortable asking questions and seeking help when needed.
        </p>

            Every great developer became as such by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it. 
          </p>
          <hr />
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Another positive aspect was the numerous networking opportunities provided. Through guest speakers and tech meetups, I was able to connect with professionals in the industry and gain valuable insights within the tech sphere. The projects I worked on were designed to mimic real-world scenarios, and in turn, give our portfolios relevance while acquainting us with the joys and challenges of teamwork given that application development is an inherently collaborative field. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the bootcamp employs a comprehensive career services dept that actively took part in resume review, interview preparation, and job placement assistance, which played a significant role in securing my first interviews as a rookie developer. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While I found the program to be reasonable and constructive, it shouldn’t go without saying that not every person can afford the cost of such programs. Fortunately, there are an abundance of free resources available for those just beginning their journey. Initiatives such as freeCodeCamp, and websites like Codecademy, and Coursera offer free computer science courses and interactive tutorials across various programming languages. Many experienced developers share their knowledge through YouTube tutorials and coding blogs, providing free access to invaluable knowledge. Contributing to open-source projects on platforms like GitHub can help aspiring programmers gain hands-on experience and ultimately build a well-rounded portfolio. Associating oneself with communities of programmers and attending local tech meetups can also provide beneficial opportunities to learn and network.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, my software engineering bootcamp experience has been transformative, equipping me with the skills and confidence to pursue a fulfilling career in tech. However, formal attendance-based education types are not the only path to success. There are numerous ways to acquire a solid foundation in this ever-evolving field. Whether you choose to attend a bootcamp, become a self-taught programmer, or even acquire a formal education in the field of comp sci, the key is to embrace the journey with dedication, perseverance, and a passion for creating. The field of software engineering is vast and ever evolving. Furthermore, the demand for coding professionals is historically high. Remember…one small step is all it takes to get your feet wet, though you may be ready to dive in sooner than you imagined. Happy Coding!

              <p>
                I am a financial services professional, unsure of my longevity in this position. Amid seeking a new route, I stumble upon and become curious of data analysis as a profession.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">2021</h4>
              <p>Eager to make a career change, I unwittingly apply to and shortly after enroll in WGU's competency based Data Analytics undergraduate degree program, overlooking it’s complexity without any knowledge of a data structure or algorithm. As a financial professional, I’m thinking more in terms of (business) intelligence/analytics currently.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">2022</h4>
              <p>
                I’ve now begun to build my technical skills. For this I used Dataquest and freeCodeCamp exclusively to remain organized in my studies. The freeCodeCamp curriculum not only introduced me to but turned me onto software development and ultimately fueled my decision to save my money and make it my own way...via portfolio. I managed to earn at least one certificate in responsive design and get through most of DSA/JS prior to the first day of bootcamp.

              <p>
                I make the timely decision to attend DevMountain’s web development bootcamp which, as you’ve read, finally gave my portfolio and I what was needed - full-stack development projects along with a network of engineers.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">Going Forward</h4>
              <p>
                As a developer who loves front-end code, with also, a knack for data analytics, I see myself combining these disciplines into one as a future freelance data visualization designer.
